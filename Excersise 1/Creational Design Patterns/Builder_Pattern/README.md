# Builder Pattern Example

This repository contains an example implementation of the Builder Pattern in Java. The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the construction of complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## Classes

### `Car`

The `Car` class represents the product that is being built. It has several attributes: `engine`, `seats`, `tripComputer`, and `gps`. The class provides setters for these attributes and a `getDetails` method to retrieve the car's details.

```java
public class Car {
    private String engine;
    private String seats;
    private String tripComputer;
    private String gps;

    // Setters and getDetails method
}


Running the Example
Compile all the Java files in the Builder_Pattern package.
Run the Main class.
Follow the prompts to enter details for the car.
The constructed car's details will be printed to the console.
Conclusion
The Builder Pattern is a powerful design pattern for constructing complex objects. It provides a clear and flexible way to create objects by separating the construction process from the object's representation.
